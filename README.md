Story:
In this game you play as a darkner named Plinko. Darkners are beings with a pitch black body and horns garnering their heads. One day at the park, Plinko is hanging out with their friends, when a lightner walks up to them, asking about a lost backpack. Lighners in this society are looked down upon as a lesser class, although the only real difference between them and the darkners are the hues of their body. The lightner, Finley, is cruelly ignored by the group, being left behind as they walk away. 
Plinko, tired, decides to retire for the day. Unfortunately, they bumps a can of white paint, coloring them ivory. For the walk home, they are berated and glared at by strangers, until they finally make it back home.
The next day, Plinko and their friends, are at the park again. In a cruel twist of fate, Finley meets Plinko there again, still looking for his bag. This time, when Plinko's friends leave in disgust, he stays behind to help Finley.  Having gone through the mistreatment from people like him, he's ready to be the change he wants to see.
